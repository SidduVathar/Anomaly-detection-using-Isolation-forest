# Anomaly-detection-using-Isolation-forest
This project helps to understand and build a simple Anomaly detection model using the Isolation forest from scikit-learn 
1. Download all the required Libraries
2. I used the numpy random number generator to Generate normal data points around two cluster centers
3. Generate anomalous data points far from the normal clusters and merge with normal datapoints
4. Created a cluster(scatter) map based on the dataset
5. Configure and train the Isolation Forest Model
6. Calculate performance metrics
